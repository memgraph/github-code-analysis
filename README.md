# Github code analysis

Hi reader and welcome to my memgraph project.

## Things to do
 - Work on frontend and backend - first thing to do is login and repos+commits getter
 - After login and repo+commits getter, I need to work on graph visualisation for filetree in frontend and backend
 - Need to create implementations for querying Memgraph in core
 - Need to create file dependency connector
 - Paging is missing from the GitHub API (maybe not needed because who needs more than 100 commits for a repo? - update: maybe needed for project commits tree but limit to 1000 requests per repo)
 - ~~User creation query is missing from QueryResponseImpls~~
 - Branches and commit graph connector is missing from DBIngest

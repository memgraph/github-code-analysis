# Github code analysis

Hi reader and welcome to my memgraph project.

## Things to do
 - GitHub API needs more error handling
 - Paging is missing from the GitHub API (maybe not needed because who needs more than 100 commits for a repo?)
 - User creation query is missing from QueryResponseImpls
 - Branches and commit getter is missing from QueryResponseImpls
 - Need to create implementations for querying Memgraph
 - Need to implement FileTree creator and connect it to Memgraph
